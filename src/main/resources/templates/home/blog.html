                  	<p>Teachers enjoy building relationships between my known and 
                  	my unknown from time to time (yes, this is learning too!) and 
                  	feeling satisfied when the unknown becomes known to me. 
                  	I wish for all our students to find this joy of learning as well 
                  	when they experience our programme and teaching.</p>

                  	<p>Our programmes are designed in consultation with industry leaders. We have internships as practice-based learning, in all our graduate programmes. These internships last between 5-months to 1 year, depending on the programmes and study format. The substantial time spent with companies ensures depth of experience and benefit for both our students and the companies they work for.</p>
